My personal rendering library, the name stands for "Shrimple OpenGL Engine". I use it whenever i need to render something in 2D or 3D.

It supports creating an OpenGL context using GLFW. There are some things laid down to support other backends like Vulkan or a software renderer on the future.

I first intended for it to be a complete game engine, but i quickly realized that i needed to reduce its scope to something more manageable.

Some other projects of mine that use this library are

- [Kappa Engine](#kappa_engine)
- [Danmaku Engine](#danmaku_engine)
- [LoRa GPS tracker](#lora_gps_tracking)
