name = "Lora GPS tracker"
desc = """
A fun college project that i work on from time to time.

It uses two LoRa transcievers and a GPS sensor to track the position for an electric car, and then shows it on the recieving end in a map that i render using [ShOGLE](#shogle) and OpenStreetMap tiles.

I intend for this project to become my college thesis in the future.
