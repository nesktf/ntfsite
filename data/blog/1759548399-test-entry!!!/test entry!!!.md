## List
Here i have a funny list of things

- [thing](https://thing.com)

- other thing without url

- **and a bold thing**

## This is a latex entry
This is an inline equation $a = 2$, with some text after

And this is a display equation

$$F(\omega) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i \pi \omega t} dt$$

So we can see that effectively that $a = 2$ and $F(\omega) = \text{funny function}$

## This is a code block
```cpp
for (const auto& [name, thing] : things) {
    std::cout << name << ", " << thing.value() << "\n";
}
```
